# gpp: Generalized Poisson P Regression Model

The gpp repository contains R code for fitting the generalized Poisson P (GP-P) regression model developed in Zamani & Ismail (2012).
The functionality in the repository will be explained in a forthcoming paper by the repository's author and his collaborator, Candace Berrett, PhD.
